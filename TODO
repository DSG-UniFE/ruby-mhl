IMPORTANT

* improve real-valued array chromosome representation support for GA
* implement measure of population diversity
* survey methods for increasing population diversity
* implement continuous optimization (also integrating Rechenberg controller
  from sisfc-optimizer)
  - can we introduce the notion of "mutation intensity"?
* implement support for easy definition of memetic algorithms
* implement SPSO (in PSO movement update, do not use the global best as informant but use
  "links" from neighboring particles)
* improve documentation
* add specs

MAYBE

* in random initialization, try using Sobol sequences (or non-linear simplex
  method or plowing method)?
* implement CLONALG?
* implement CMA-ES?
* implement biased random key genetic algorithms?
* implement more rigorous constraint management according to CoelloCoello11?
